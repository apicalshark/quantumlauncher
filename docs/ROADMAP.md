# Servers

The server manager is highly incomplete and under
active development, so it's temporarily disabled.

This will allow you to setup and host Minecraft servers
across the internet from a single click. Think Aternos
but local and ad-free.

- [x] Create/delete/run Minecraft servers
- [x] Editing basic server settings (RAM, Java, Args)
- [ ] Editing `server.properties`
- [ ] Editing NBT config files
- [ ] Plugin store
- [ ] [playit.gg](https://playit.gg) integration
- [ ] Version-control based world rollback system
- [ ] Detect `world/session.lock` error and auto-fix it

## Loaders

- [x] Paper
- [ ] Spigot
- [ ] Bukkit
- [ ] Bungeecoord
- [ ] [Combining mod-loaders and plugin-loaders](https://github.com/LeStegii/server-software/blob/master/java/MODS+PLUGINS.md)

# Command-Line interface

- [x] `list-instances`, `-l`
- [x] `list-available-versions`, `-a`
- [x] `create NAME VERSION`
- [x] `launch INSTANCE USERNAME`
- [ ] `loader install/uninstall/info`
- [ ] Mod installation features from CLI
- [ ] Preset, modpack features from CLI
