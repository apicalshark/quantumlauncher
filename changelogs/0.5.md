# Mod Loaders

- You can now install OptiFine and Forge together!
- Added CLI commands to manage loaders: `quantum_launcher loader install/info/uninstall`

Added alternate fabric implementations for versions without official Fabric support:

- **Legacy Fabric** (`1.3`-`1.13`)
- **OrnitheMC** (`b1.7`-`1.13`)
- **Babric** and **Cursed Legacy** (`b1.7.3`)

# UX

- Export mods as a shareable text list with optional links!
- Write instance-specific notes for coordinates, todo lists, etc!
- Many small UX improvements and polish
- The launcher will now remember the last-selected instance (toggleable)

## Themes

- Added Auto light/dark mode (syncs with system)
- Added themes:
  - "Adwaita" greyish theme (GNOME-inspired)
  - "Halloween" orange/amber theme (thanks @Sreehari425)

## Create Instance

Overhauled the Create Instance screen, now with:
- Sidebar to view versions
- Filters for release/snapshot/beta/... (thanks @Sreehari425)
- Search bar
- Auto-filling version and name by default

## Mod Menu

Revamped the mod menu, now with:

- **Icons**, search and context menus
- Easy bulk-selection (ctrl-a, shift/ctrl+click)
- Better aesthetics and layout

Also:

- **Drastically** improved mod description page rendering in the store,
  now with fewer visual glitches/missing items
- Added option to include/exclude configuration in mod presets (thanks @Sreehari425)

## Keyboard Navigation

Note: Use Command instead of Ctrl on macOS

- `Ctrl/Alt + 1/2/3` to switch tabs in main screen
- `Ctrl + ,` to open settings

Creating instance:
- `Ctrl + N` to open screen
- `Ctrl + F` to search versions (and `Enter` to select)
- `Ctrl + Enter` to confirm

# Experiments

A few experimental features have been enabled for users to try out.
Please try them and report any bugs or feedback!

## 1) Server Manager

Enabled a *sneak-peek* of the server manager.
You can use it to create and host your own servers!

> **WARNING**: Very buggy and incomplete.
> You will face frustration if you try and daily-drive this right now.

- Enable it through the CLI flag: `--enable-server-manager`
- For others to join, you'll need <https://playit.gg> or port forwarding
  (no auto-setup yet)
- Supports mod loaders, mod store, sending commands, viewing logs
- More features coming soon!

## 2) Importing from MultiMC

You can now import `.zip` instances from MultiMC and PrismLauncher!

- Enable it through the CLI flag: `--enable-mmc-import`
- Go to New instance > Import from MultiMC
- Still experimental, may not work for all instances
- If you find incompatibilities, please report them on GitHub!
  (upload your instance if possible)
